our team:
Eran Keren 200839710
Assaf Yehudai 201182003

some guide lines:
The App was tested on mozilla firefox only! 

We have splitted the projects between us because it was too big too upload from the same user.

So Eran have uploaded the web client and servlets as a zip containing a single project.
Assaf has uploded the big web service and the engine for the game.
Engine is in a differente project and must be added as a library to the big web service project,
instructions are in the zip assaf has uploaded.

Please advise that on windows it will be the best if all the projects directories will be on c:/
since it makes trouble if not.

For more info you know how to reach us :) Hope we didn't forget any guidlines.
